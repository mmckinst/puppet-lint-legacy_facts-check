## Overview

Puppet 3.5 [optionally added structured
facts](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/puppet/3.5/release_notes.markdown#structured-facts-early-version)
as well as the [global facts
hash](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/puppet/3.5/release_notes.markdown#global-facts-hash). They
were both turned on by default in puppet 4.

This linter will convert from legacy facts like `$::operatingsystem` or legacy
hashed facts like `$facts['operatingsystem']` to the new structured facts like
`$facts['os']['name']`.

If you only want to convert from facts like `$::operatingsystem` to the facts
hash like `$facts['operatingsystem']`, you want the [top scope facts
linter](https://github.com/mmckinst/puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check).

## Installing

### From the command line

```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-legacy_facts-check
```

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-legacy_facts-check', :require => false
```

## Checks

#### What you have done

```puppet
$package_name = $::operatingsystem {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

```puppet
$package_name = $facts['operatingsystem'] {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
$package_name = $facts['os']['name'] {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-legacy_facts` to your puppet-lint
command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-legacy_facts path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should
insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_legacy_facts')
```

Alternatively, you can disable it directly in your puppet manifest.

```puppet
# lint:ignore:legacy_facts
$package_name = $facts['operatingsystem'] {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
# lint:endignore
```

## Limitations

The linter can only scan known facts in the codebase, custom facts cannot be scanned.

The linter will only find and work on top scope facts like `$::osfamily`,
non-top scope facts like `$osfamily` will not be found or fixed. 

Some facts have no equivalent in the structured fact list:

### `memoryfree_mb`

There is no fact that returns exclusively in MiB.

The closest equivalent is `$facts['memory']['system'][available']` or
`$facts['memory']['system']['available_bytes']`.

See
[facter documentation on memory](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/3.12/core_facts.html#memory).

### `memorysize_mb`

There is no fact that returns exclusively in MiB.

The closest equivalent is `$facts['memory']['system']['total']` or
`$facts['memory']['system']['total_bytes']`.

See [facter documentation on memory](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/3.12/core_facts.html#memory).

### `swapfree_mb`

There is no fact that returns exclusively in MiB.

The closest equivalent is `$facts['memory']['swap']['available']` or
`$facts['memory']['swap']['available_bytes']`.

See [facter documentation on memory](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/3.12/core_facts.html#memory).

### `swapsize_mb`

There is no fact that returns exclusively in MiB.

The closest equivalent is `$facts['memory']['swap']['used']` or
`$facts['memory']['swap']['used_bytes']`.

See [facter documentation on memory](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/3.12/core_facts.html#memory).

### `blockdevices`

This returns a string containing all block devices separated by a comma.

This can be duplicated using
[puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib) and the
following: `join(keys($facts['disks']), ',')`

### `interfaces`

This returns a string containing all interfaces separated by a comma.

This can be duplicated using
[puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib) and the
following: `join(keys($facts['networking']['interfaces']), ',')`.

### `zones`

This returns a string containing all zone names separated by a comma.

This can be duplicated using
[puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib) and the
following: `join(keys($facts['solaris_zones']['zones']), ',')`

### `sshfp_dsa`

This returns a string containing both the SHA1 and SHA256 fingerprint for the
DSA algorithm.

This can be duplicated using the following string:
`"$facts['ssh']['dsa']['fingerprints']['sha1']
$facts['ssh']['dsa']['fingerprints']['sha256']"`

### `sshfp_ecdsa`

This returns a string containing both the SHA1 and SHA256 fingerprint for the
ECDSA algorithm.

This can be duplicated using the following string:
`"$facts['ssh']['ecdsa']['fingerprints']['sha1']
$facts['ssh']['ecdsa']['fingerprints']['sha256']"`

### `sshfp_ed25519`

This returns a string containing both the SHA1 and SHA256 fingerprint for the
Ed25519 algorithm.

This can be duplicated using the following string:
`"$facts['ssh']['ed25519']['fingerprints']['sha1']
$facts['ssh']['ed25519']['fingerprints']['sha256']"`

### `sshfp_rsa`

This returns a string containing both the SHA1 and SHA256 fingerprint for the
RSA algorithm.

This can be duplicated using the following string:
`"$facts['ssh']['rsa']['fingerprints']['sha1']
$facts['ssh']['rsa']['fingerprints']['sha256']"`
